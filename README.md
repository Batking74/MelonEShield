## Description
MelonEShield is a robust Security Checklist application designed to ensure that every project meets essential website standards for a quality web app. As a freelancer, you often juggle multiple aspects of web development, and this tool helps me systematically manage and verify that all critical measures are in place for each client project. The app allows for creating measures, deleting measures, and tracking checklist progress as you check off measures, ensuring that nothing is overlooked. Once completed, detailed documentation can be generated to provide clients with a clear view of the steps taken to secure and optimize their website.


## My Motivation
The motivation behind MelonEShield stemmed from the need to streamline and enhance the quality assurance process when developing web applications for myself and potential clients. Ensuring that every client project adheres to best practices in security, SEO, and performance can be challenging, especially when managing multiple projects simultaneously. MelonEShield was created to alleviate this burden by providing a structured and efficient way to track and implement all necessary measures, ultimately leading to higher-quality outcomes and client satisfaction.


## Websites Purpose
The primary purpose of MelonEShield is to serve as a comprehensive tool for myself, to ensure that all aspects of my personal websites/projects and client projects are secure, optimized, and compliant with industry best practices. Its also a tool used for providing detailed documentation for clients about all measures that were implemented.
